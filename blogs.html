                            <p>Today’s date is the one in which people are highly competitive and their approach towards
                                life now is quick, intellectually and fast. They have restricted themselves just to the
                                corporate world, where there is a lot of fierce competition. One has no time for
                                themselves. The work pressure doesn’t allow them to come out of the cocoon and breathe.
                                A break from your daily life is much needed for everyone. Continuous working has an
                                adverse effect on your health and restricts your thought process to just one field.
                                The perfect way to enjoy your break from work is going for a vacation to a hill station.
                                Our country has some amazing hill stations. Himachal Pradesh is one state that has many
                                hill stations and is the best option for a perfect holiday, especially in the summers.
                                Rajgarh, one of the beautiful & unexplored hill stations, is surrounded by forests.
                                Right from numerous streams, relaxed, healthy and fresh air, and attractive surroundings
                                to the snowline, Rajgarh has everything that is required for a perfect holiday.
                                How is Rajgarh different from other hill stations?
                                As mentioned earlier, it’s a place that people of any age group can visit because it’s

                                haunts us and fills us with hope. ” ― Adam Leith Gollner.
                                The idea of biophilia is the notion that humans possess an instinctive tendency to seek
                                out connections with nature and other forms of life. There’s a growing body of anecdotal
                                and scientific research that validates the benefits generated by a proximity to
                                nature—or elements that mimic it—and supports the trend toward nature-centric design. we
                                have depended on nature for almost our entire existence during which nature has become
                                critical to human’s physical-mental health, and well-being. Modern world forces –
                                especially indoor environments devoid of nature – have a negative impact on the human
                                mind in the long run. And in current times, where the world is rapidly urbanizing, it is
                                extremely crucial to understand the mental health benefits of nature. Embedding nature
                                and natural systems in urban design and indoor, built environments is important in order
                                to keep the human mind, body, and sense connected to a bio-centric world. tshé valley’s
                                design and layout have been developed keeping the biophilia and nature integrated
